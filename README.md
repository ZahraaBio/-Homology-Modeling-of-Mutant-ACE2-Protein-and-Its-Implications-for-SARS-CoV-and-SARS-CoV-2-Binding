# Homology Modeling of Mutant ACE2 Protein and Its Implications for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Binding
In collaboration with my team (Sara and Rand), we conducted a computational study to investigate the effects of specific mutations in the ACE2 protein on its interaction with the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We utilized Python to manipulate the wild-type ACE2 sequence and generate FASTA sequences for two mutant forms. Using Swiss-Model, we predicted 3D structures of these mutated proteins.
The mutations analyzed were:

Lysine (K) to Aspartic Acid (D) at position 31, which abolishes interaction with SARS-CoV, potentially conferring resistance to the virus.
Lysine (K) to Tyrosine (Y) at the same position, which increases interaction with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting enhanced susceptibility to the virus.
We compared the wild-type and mutant structures using PyMol and presented a detailed analysis of the binding changes. Our findings provide insights into how mutations could alter viral binding specificity and potential impacts on viral infectivity.
